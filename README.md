# Entando-docs
Project to hold the Ascii doc formated documentation for the Entando Digital Experience platform

# Overview
* All of the Asciidoc files are in `src/main/asciidoc`
* The top level file is in docs/index.adoc and the child sections are imported from their respecitve folders

# Editing the Docs
* An Asciidoc editor is recommended. Like Atom or the IntelliJ Asciidoc plugins
* Checkout the documentation with `git clone https://github.com/entando/entando-docs`
* Open with the editor and make changes or add docs. The root of the documentation is `docs/index.adoc`
* Building the docs requires an installation of the asciidoctor tool

# Building the Docs
* Go to the asciidoc folder `cd entando-docs/docs/src/main/asciidoc`

# Styling the Docs
* Go to the stylesheets folder `cd entando-docs/docs/src/main/asciidoc/stylesheets/`
* Edit file  `menuoverride.css ` to add or override default css styling

Keep in mind that Fontawesome v.5.3.1 has be added to the project so changing menu icons is fairly easy

 * Go to the asciidoc folder `cd entando-docs/docs/src/main/asciidoc/js/headScript.js`
 * In order to change icons locate `expandButtonText` and `collapseButtonText` variables in  `headScript.js`. Icons can be also entirely removed and text or images can be used to replace them.
