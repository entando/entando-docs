There are different ways to develop the widgets for blueprint. One developer-friendly way would be to use generated widgets as starting point for local development - generate the widgets and work on them to improve and see the changes live. If you initialize git inside the generated widgets folder, you will be able to use git diff to quickly find issues in templates.

1. Generate the widgets using Conference entity. Move generated widgets to a different folder, add git. Work on the widgets you want to change or improve. When you are happy with the result - commit and push your changes locally.
1. Remove the generated widgets folders and run Change watcher (refer to Blueprint generated widgets' change watcher overview section). Pass entity argument for Entity name (the one that already has .json in your micro-service folder), path to your micro-service and path to blueprint. I highly suggest using a different name for an entity (nothing containing “Conference”) - this will help in later steps.
1. If you have changed something in package.json - change the template for it at the beginning.
1. Go to generated widget in micro-service and run `npm i && npm start`. The change watcher's regenerate command overwrites the files, but doesn't delete anything so you won't need to `npm install` each time you change something.
1. You can move generated widget to your development "repo" you have worked on and using git diff (as you changes have been committed) you can go through each change and update the templates accordingly (at this point I seldomly look at the served generated widget as it will be breaking quite often). When working on templates, one place you can check is the Change watcher logs - if templates are incorrect, the entity regeneration will fail with some helpful information.
1. After you cover most of it, start checking and fixing the issues on the served widget in browser or console (the logs are not very detailed but you should get a hold of it pretty fast)
1. Search for a word “Conference” in your template to check if you haven’t missed any variables.
1. When you are done and the widget is running fine, generate the widget with Conference entity.
1. Diff the generated widget to the development "repo" and see if there are differences. Basically, the only differences should be the test mocks as they are generated each time.
