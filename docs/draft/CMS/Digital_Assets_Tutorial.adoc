The image file that you just uploaded is displayed in the list; a statistical overview of the number of the uploaded resources (images and documents) is provided. The App Builder’s interface allows the users to choose grid and list view; most of the time, users prefer to use list view when they are searching with specific requirements, while they love grid view for exploring. For every resource, image, or document, the list shows the following information:
