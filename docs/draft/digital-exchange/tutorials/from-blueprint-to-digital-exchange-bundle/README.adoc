= From blueprint to the digital-exchange bundle
:toc:

= Purpose

In this tutorial you will learn how to generate a bundle from a microservice generated using the JHipster's Entando Blueprint.

= Requirements
* You have built a micro-service with the entando-blueprint. 
* Node and NPM are installed on your machine
* You have an NPM registry where to upload the bundle and you are logged in there
* Docker installed on your machine and you can upload images to docker-hub

= Steps

NOTE: In this tutorial we will assume you have generated at least an entity for your microservice

== 1. Generate an entity
In order to include auto-generated micro-frontends to your bundle you will need use the `jhispter entity` generator. Let's assume we want to generate a simple _Conference_ entity

----
jhipster entity conference
----

Let's use these options:

- One field of type `String` called `name` with no validation
- No relationships with other entities
- REST controller should use the repository directly
- No pagination for the entity

== 2. Populate the bundle with the micro-frontends

To populate the bundle with the generated micro-frontends, just run the `./buildBundle.sh` script or use the npm

----
npm run populate-bundle
----

IMPORTANT: The bundle population with the micro-frontends requires sometime to be processed, you should be able to follow the progress
of the operation on screen

== 3. Generate a docker image for your microservice
JHipster uses the JIB Maven plugin to generate a docker image for your microservice. 

By default the output image will use the name of your application and the `latest` tag, eg. `entando/jhipster@latest`.

----
./mvnw -Pprod clean package jib:dockerBuild [-Djib.to.image=<your-image-name]
----

NOTE: By default the organization used for the image is `entando` but you can simply change it in the `pom.xml` file or by providing the `-Djib.to.image=<org>/<name>:<version>` to the jib:dockerBuild command.

NOTE: Output image name is controlled in the `pom.xml` file but could also be customized in the `./mvnw` command using the `-Djib.to.image` parameter. 

WARNING: If you change the target image of the docker build, remember to update the plugin metadata in the bundle accordingly.

== 4. Publish the Docker image to Docker registry (DockerHub or equivalent) 

Let's now publish the docker image for the microservice to make it available later during bundle installation in the cluster
----
docker push <name-of-the-image:tag>
----

== 5. Publish the bundle to an Npm registry

Now let's publish the bundle to your private NPM registry. From the `bundle` folder of your jhipster project
----
npm publish . --registry=<your-private-registry-url>
----

== 6. Generate the EntandoDeBundle K8S custom resource

You should now be able to generate an EntandoDeBundle custom resource using the `entando-bundle` command-line tool.

WARNING: Make sure both the NPM registry where you published the bundle and the Docker registry where you published the docker image are accessbile in read mode without restrictions

----
entando-bundle generate --dry-run <your-bundle-name> --registry=<your-private-registry> [--name=<custom-name>] [--namespace=<namespace-to-deploy>] > jhipster-bundle.yaml
----

== 7. Deploy the EntandoDeBundle custom resource on the cluster

Finally, let's deploy the previously generated custom resource on the kubernetes/openshift cluster
----
kubectl create -f jhipster-bundle.yaml
----

= Conclusion

You now should have the bundle available in your cluster and accessible from AppBuilder.
