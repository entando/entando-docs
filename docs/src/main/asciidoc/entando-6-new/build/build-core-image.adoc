== Setup

1. Clone the application at: https://github.com/entando-k8s/entando-sample-app using
+
```
git clone https://github.com/entando-k8s/entando-sample-app
```
+
2. On a command line, cd into the entando-sample-app you just cloned:
+
```
cd entando-sample-app
```
+
3. Build a docker image from the core app
+
```
mvn clean package -Pwildfly -Pderby docker:build
```
+
4. View the images installed on your local docker instance
+
```
docker images
```
+
Look for
+
```
entando/entando-sample-app:latest
```
+
5. Create a repository on your docker repository to house your new application
6. Re-tag the image you just built with your repo
+
```
 docker tag entando/entando-sample-app:latest [your-user]/[your-repo-name]:latest
```
+
7. Push the Image to your Repository

```
docker push [your-user]/[your-repo-name]:latest
```
