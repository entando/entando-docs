= GETTING STARTED WITH ENTANDO

== SAMPLE MORTGAGE APPLICATION

=== PREFACE
The Entando App Builder helps you create a variety of applications and integrate them with Red Hat BPM. It uses an intuitive UI, reusable templates, and drag-and-drop functionality that allows you to participate in every stage of the application design process regardless of your level of coding knowledge.

//RESTORE THIS PARAGRAPH WITH THE LENDING APPLICATION
//This demonstration walks through creating two applications in a mortgage lending process: an applicant page and an lender page. Both pages will integrate with Red Hat BPM.

This demonstration walks through creating an applicant page for a mortgage application, and then integrates with Red Hat PAM.

*Prerequisites:*

* Entando MApp Engine and App Builder installed

=== CONFIGURING THE APPLICANT PAGE
The Applicant page is a public-facing webpage.

==== CREATING A NEW PAGE MODEL
Page models are reusable templates. They determine the page layout via frames into which you can then drag and drop content and widgets.

.To create a new page model:
. Open the Entando App Builder.
. From the tabs along the top, select UX Patterns > Page Models > *Add*.
. Assign the page model a code and a name. Codes represent the page model’s unique identifier. The name can be more human readable. For example: +
*Code:* _entando$$_$$page$$_$$purple_ +
*Name:* _Purple - BPM_
