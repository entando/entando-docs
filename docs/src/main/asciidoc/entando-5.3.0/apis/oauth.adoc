== INTRODUCTION
Entando uses the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0 authorization framework] to determine the methods for granting client applications access tokens to authenticate a request to an API endpoint. Access tokens allow API providers to authenticate their system’s users.

== CREATING A CONSUMER
From the Entando dashboard, select Integrations > API Management > Consumers. This opens the Consumers screen with a search utility and a table of existing API Keys.

.To create a new access token:

. Click *Add*.
. Provide values for each of the fields. Different grant types require values for different parameters.

** Key
** Secret
** Name
** Description
** Callback URL - URL to open after the user successfully authenticates
** Scope - Defines the level of access that this token grants
** Expiration date
. Toggle all the grant types that your application will accept:
** Authentication code: used by web and mobile apps and requires the app to launch a browser to begin the flow. Generally, the flow follows these steps:
.. The application opens a browser and connects the user with the OAuth server
.. The OAuth server prompts the user with an authorization and the user approves the app’s request
.. The user is returned to the application with an authorization code in the query string where the application exchanges it for an access token.
** Password: only involves a single step: the application prompts the user to enter a standard username and password into a login form to collect the user’s credentials. The app then makes a POST request to the server to exchange the password for an access token.
** Client credentials: suitable for machine-to-machine authentication to obtain an access token outside the context of a user. This is generally for clients that need information about themselves rather than about a user.
** Refresh token: a token used to generate additional access tokens. This allows your application to deploy short-lived access tokens without having to collect credentials when one expires. The app requests this token along with the access and/or ID tokens as part of the user’s initial authentication.
** Implicit: represents a way for a single-page JavaScript app to get an access token without an intermediate code exchange step. Implicit grant types are most often used by public clients.
. Click *Save* to create the access token.
