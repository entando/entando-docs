= GETTING STARTED WITH ENTANDO APP BUILDER

== SAMPLE MORTGAGE APPLICATION PROJECT

=== PREFACE
The Entando App Builder helps you create a variety of applications and integrate them with Red Hat BPM. It uses an intuitive UI, reusable templates, and drag-and-drop functionality that allows you to participate in every stage of the application design process regardless of your level of coding knowledge.

//RESTORE THIS PARAGRAPH WITH THE LENDING APPLICATION
//This demonstration walks through creating two applications in a mortgage lending process: an applicant page and an lender page. Both pages will integrate with Red Hat BPM.

This demonstration walks through creating an applicant page for a mortgage application, and then integrates with Red Hat PAM.

*Prerequisites:*

* Entando App Builder and Core installed

=== CONFIGURING THE APPLICANT PAGE
The Applicant page is a public-facing webpage.

*Code:* _entando$$_$$page$$_$$purple_ +
