== INITIAL SETUP
Entando manages projects with Maven; we also use Ant to automate several tasks.

== CONFIGURING ANT
To configure Ant, open the file _buildProperties.xml_ in the root of the project. The root of an Entando project is the directory where the _pom.xml_ file resides.

By default, the _buildProperties.xml_ file includes the properties for PostGresSQL and MySQL. To configure Ant, you must edit the values that pertain to your target DBMS. You can ignore any unused properties.

.Values you must configure:

* Database address, username, and password
* Database executable path
----
<property name="postgres.hostname" value="localhost" />
<property name="postgres.port" value="5432" />
<property name="postgres.username" value="agile" />
<property name="postgres.password" value="agile" />

<property name="mysql.hostname" value="localhost" />
<property name="mysql.port" value="3306" />
<property name="mysql.username" value="agile" />
<property name="mysql.password" value="agile" />
----

Once configured, you need to declare the path of the target DBMS executables in either the PostgreSQL or MySQL section. The following properties are grouped by operating system, so be sure to configure properties under the correction OS and then comment out the remaining operating systems.

----
<!-- Properties definitions for *nix machines START -->
<property name="tomcat.home.path" value="/opt/tomcat6" />
<property name="postgres.bin.path" location="/Library/PostgreSQL/9.5/bin/" />
<property name="postgres.bin.dump" value="pg_dump" />
<property name="postgres.bin.psql" value="psql" />
<property name="postgres.bin.restore" value="pg_restore" />
<property name="postgres.bin.drop" value="dropdb" />
<property name="postgres.bin.create" value="createdb" />
<property name="mysql.bin.path" location="/usr/bin" />
<property name="mysql.bin.dump" value="mysqldump" />
<property name="mysql.bin.restore" value="mysql" />
<property name="mysql.bin.create" value="mysql" />
<property name="mysql.bin.drop" value="mysql" />
<property name="ant-contrib.jar.path" location="/usr/bin/java/ant-contrib.jar" />
<!-- Properties definitions for *nix machines END -->
----

The only properties to adjust are those regarding the path of the executables, e.g., _postgres.bin.path_ or _mysql.bin.path_.

=== ADDITIONAL SETTINGS FOR WINDOWS
If you are a Windows user, you must also modify the file _buildTasks.xml_, otherwise Maven will not start correctly and will throw a “file not found” error.

=== WINDOWS 10
Find and edit all seven instances of executable=”mvn” in the _buildTasks.xml_ file. Entando 5 contains seven total instances.

*Change from:*
----
executable="mvn"
----

*to:*

----
executable="mvn.cmd"
----

=== OTHER WINDOWS VERSIONS
Find and edit all seven instances of executable=”mvn” in the _buildTasks.xml_ file. Entando 5 contains seven total instances.

*Change from:*
----
executable="mvn"
----

to:

----
executable="mvn.bat"
----

=== ANT TASKS
After you have correctly declared the executable paths in _buildProperties.xml_, you can begin executing Ant tasks to perform management operations.

These tasks include the creation of the WAR file and database management.

To retrieve the list of available tasks, run the following command from the terminal window or command prompt:

----
ant -p
----

The result shows all running tasks, similar to the following:

image::firstdev_runningTasks.png[639,439]

====
IMPORTANT: Remember that the tasks aimed at database management will only impact the relevant project’s database. For example, in a project named _entandodemo_, the task _PG-db-drop_ will only drop the _entandodemoPort_ and _entandodemoServ_ databases. Similarly, creating a dump will involve the same databases.
====

*Tasks for PostgreSQL:*

====
TIP: Before using the PostgreSQL related tasks, you need to create the following directory in your project ./src/main/db/backup/tar. This directory is only necessary for using a PostGresSQL database.
====

* *PG-db-create:* creates the databases for the current project +
This item won’t appear in the list

* *PG-db-drop:* drops the default databases of the project +
This item won’t appear in the list

* *PG-db-backup-tar:* dumps and compresses the databases, placing the file in ./src/main/db/backup/tar +
Remember that you must create the 'tar' directory beforehand

* *PG-db-full-update-tar:* restores the dump created with the previous command +
The process drops databases before the restore takes place


*Tasks for MySQL:*

* *MySQL-db-backup:* dumps the project databases +
NOTE: the dump will be placed in the src/db/mysql

* *MySQL-db-create:* creates the project databases

* *MySQL-db-drop:* drops default project databases

* *MySQL-db-full-update:* runs a database update +
NOTE: the dump must be present in src/db/mysql

* *MySQL-db-restore:* drops existing tables, then restores the dump +
NOTE: the dump must be present in src/db/mysql

*General tasks:*

* *WAR-build:* creates the WAR of the project for Apache Tomcat

* *WAR-build-jboss:* creates the WAR of the project for JBoss / Wildfly

== TROUBLESHOOTING
Most setup errors result from an improper configuration in either _buildProperties.xml_ or, for Windows users, _buildTasks.xml_.

.To resolve an issue, ensure that each of the following is correct:

* The path of DBMS binaries _postgres.bin.path_ or _mysql.bin.path_

* Username and password for accessing the database. By default, both the username and password are “agile”

* The URL of the database. The default is ”localhost”


== FILTER MANAGEMENT
Filters contain key:value pairs that Entando uses in templates to generate essential files such as _context.xml_ and _web.xml_. Each filter generates slightly different xml depending on the target environment, developer, or production environment.

The contents of the filters are very similar with the main difference being the name. Different commands select different filters for use. Development filters are identical; production filters differ by one property. Filter contents are essentially identical in all the other respects.

Entando comes with the Jetty plugin and Derby as servlet container and database, respectively. As such, you do not need to edit any filter to run a newly created Entando project. Filters are only modified by developers when developing a project, such as one using a database other than Derby.

=== DEVELOPMENT FILTERS
Development filters operate during the development phase of the project; each operating system has its own version of the filter.

* *Unix:* filter-development-unix.properties
* *Windows:* filter-development-windows.properties

The command `+mvn clean jetty:run+` selects the appropriate filter to generate the context or web XML files.

=== PRODUCTION FILTERS
DevOps teams usually prepare the production filters and contain the values intended for the target production (staging) environment.

Production filters co-exist with development filters with no overlap between them.

.There are two production filters:

* *Tomcat:* filter-production.properties
* *JBoss or Wildfly:* filter-production-jboss.properties

The command `+ant WAR-build+`, for Tomcat application servers, uses the filter-production.properties filter. Templates that generate the _context.xml_ and _web.xml_ files are in the directory ./src/main/config.

The command `+ant WAR-build-jboss+` uses the filter-production-jboss.properties filter. The template that generates the _web.xml_ is in the directory ./src/main/config/jboss.

=== FILTER SETUP
Filters are highly customizable. The following paragraphs list adjustments to the basic properties for getting started. Each of the values in this section are from the _filter-development-{operating system}.properties_ file.

=== NETWORK SETUP
Make changes to your network. The properties below come with predefined values for development and production filters. Change them as-needed to fit your target environment.

----
profile.application.baseurl.hostname
profile.application.baseurl.port
profile.application.baseurl.port.separator
----

=== SERVLET CONTAINER SETUP - TOMCAT
This is valid for the _filter-development-unix_, _filter-development-windows_ and _filter-production_.

Edit the _profile.tomcat.home_ property to reflect the path of Tomcat’s installation directory.

=== APPLICATION SERVER SETUP - JBOSS/WILDFLY
Edit the _profile.jboss.home_ property to reflect the path JBoss or Wildfly installation directory.

=== DATABASE SETUP
Each filter comes with sets of declarations for common databases. By default, all sets are commented out except for Derby.

To enable Entando to connect a different database, you must uncomment the appropriate database set and then comment out the Derby set. In addition, edit the following properties to fit your destination environment:

----
profile.database.hostname=localhost
profile.database.port=1527
profile.database.username=agile
profile.database.password=agile
----

Entando supports most common RDBMSes out-of-the-box. If your target database does not appear in the list (e.g., Oracle), your developers must create the properties in the filters.

== CONFIGURING SWAGGER (OPTIONAL)

When generating an application, Entando automatically includes an instance of Swagger, a tool that lets you describe the structure of your APIs to make them easier for other machines to read. Configuring Swagger for use only takes a few steps.


=== ENABLING SWAGGER IN A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
To enable swagger in your development environment, you need to run your application with an enabled Swagger profile. There are two options. Run ONE of the following from the  root of your generated project's directory:

* Start the container with a JVM parameter using the following command: +
`mvn clean jetty:run -Dspring.profiles.active=swagger`

* Add an environment variable by using the following commands: +
`export spring_profiles_active=swagger` +
`mvn clean jetty:run`

.To access the Swagger interface:

. In a browser, navigate to your application’s URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080/appname).
. Append the URL with api/swagger-ui.html. Again, for example, http://localhost:8080/appname/api/swagger-ui.html
+
[NOTE]
=====
For security purposes, you should only run this with the default credentials in a development environment. If enabling swagger in production for integration purposes be sure to change the clientId and secret.
=====

=== AUTHENTICATION DETAILS

*Default login details:* +
*Username:* admin +
*Password:* adminadmin

*Default Swagger OAuth details:* +
*Type:* Request Body +
*clientId:* swagger +
*Secret:* = swaggerswagger

=== HOW DOES THE INTEGRATION WORK?
The Swagger integration is based on three components and is activated by a Spring profile. The components are:

* *SwaggerConfig* - responsible for configuring most of the Swagger UI behavior (or the library Springfox that provides Swagger UI functionality). It configures which paths to scan, where to find the oAuth endpoints, and other essentials

* *SwaggerMvcAdapter* - makes the Swagger UI's human-friendly HTML page and its resources available for the application

* *SwaggerInitializer* - assists the Swagger UI with talking to your new application. Swagger UI needs to talk to the application backend, which require oAuth authentication to communicate back to the Swagger UI. The backend uses standard oAuth authentication, requiring an oAuth client_id and secret, and also that any requested redirect matches a specific URL. SwaggerInitializer is also responsible for adding the oAuth consumer details for Swagger in the database. If Swagger is enabled when the application starts, SwaggerInitializer will check for an existing configuration for a Swagger consumer in the database and adds one if necessary

If the _swagger_ Spring profile is active, Spring will initialize and wire all three components during application startup. If inactive, Entando ignores the components.

== BUILDING A REST API

To extend the Entando REST API interfaces you can create new REST controllers in your application and utilize the existing Entando configuration for Swagger and security.

. Create your REST controller(s) in your application in a package of your choice
. Create a Spring context file that scans the package where your controllers were created
. Add the spring context file created in step 2 to a location scanned by the web.xml in your app. We recommend creating the context in `src/main/resouces/spring/aps/api` but any scanned package will work
.. Ensure that the base-package path in the context-scan contains your controllers

An example context file to scan the package `com.my.app` for controllers:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
http://www.springframework.org/schema/context http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

	<context:component-scan base-package="com.my.app" />

</beans>
```

Once configured the endpoints will be enabled by Spring and the endpoint documentation will be available in Swagger if enabled. See <<_configuring_swagger_optional,Configuring Swagger>>

== OAUTH 2.0 ON ENTANDO
Entando uses the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0 authorization framework] to determine the methods for granting client applications access tokens to authenticate a request to an API endpoint. Access tokens allow API providers to authenticate their system’s users.

== CREATING A CONSUMER
From the Entando dashboard, select Integrations > API Management > Consumers. This opens the Consumers screen with a search utility and a table of existing API Keys.

image::oauth_consumers.png[width='50%']

.To create a new access token:

. Click *Add*.
. Provide values for each of the fields. Different grant types require values for different parameters.
+
image::oauth_paramters.png[width='50%']
** Key
** Secret
** Name
** Description
** Callback URL - URL to open after the user successfully authenticates
** Scope - Defines the level of access that this token grants
** Expiration date
. Toggle all the grant types that your application will accept:
** Authentication code: used by web and mobile apps and requires the app to launch a browser to begin the flow. Generally, the flow follows these steps:
.. The application opens a browser and connects the user with the OAuth server
.. The OAuth server prompts the user with an authorization and the user approves the app’s request
.. The user is returned to the application with an authorization code in the query string where the application exchanges it for an access token.
** Password: only involves a single step: the application prompts the user to enter a standard username and password into a login form to collect the user’s credentials. The app then makes a POST request to the server to exchange the password for an access token.
** Client credentials: suitable for machine-to-machine authentication to obtain an access token outside the context of a user. This is generally for clients that need information about themselves rather than about a user.
** Refresh token: a token used to generate additional access tokens. This allows your application to deploy short-lived access tokens without having to collect credentials when one expires. The app requests this token along with the access and/or ID tokens as part of the user’s initial authentication.
** Implicit: represents a way for a single-page JavaScript app to get an access token without an intermediate code exchange step. Implicit grant types are most often used by public clients.
. Click *Save* to create the access token.

== IMAGEMAGICK SETUP
When you upload an image to Entando through the CMS plugin, it is automatically cropped into different formats to produce thumbnails ready to be used when presenting contents.

Entando uses a third party application called ImageMagick which is available for both Linux and Windows.

To crop the images properly, Entando requires that the ImageMagick library be present in the system. You can override this setting using steps for the relevant OS below.

[NOTE]
====
Generally, only Windows systems require setup. You only need to set up a Linux system if you need to switch off thumbnail generation.
====

=== LINUX/MAC SETUP
Open the file systemParams.properties in the directory ./src/main/config of the Entando project.

==== TOGGLING THUMBNAIL CREATION ON AND OFF
Adjust the _imagemagick.enabled_ property to either True or False.

----
# set this parameter to true if imagemagick is installed on the system and you need to use it
imagemagick.enabled=true
----

=== WINDOWS SETUP
Configure the following properties to reflect the installation directory of ImageMagick on Windows:

----
imagemagick.windows=true
imagemagick.path=C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick-6.6.3-Q16
----

[NOTE]
====
The CMS plugin will throw a 500 error if you upload an image with an improperly configured ImageMagick setup.
