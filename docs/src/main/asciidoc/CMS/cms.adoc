== INTRODUCTION
Access Entando's Content Management System features from the left pane by selecting APPS > CMS. The CMS modules contain functions that let you manage contents, their type, model, and digital assets. This section provides an overview of the tasks associated with each of the CMS subsections, which are not necessarily arranged sequentially for a first-time setup.

* Contents
* Digital Assets
* Content Types
* Content Models
* Content Settings

Generally speaking, the flow for creating content is:
Create a Content Type > Create a Content Model for the newly created Type > Create Contents and Digital Assets > Publish the contents

=== DEFINING CONTENT MANAGEMENT SECTIONS

Contents::
Contents are the human consumable pieces of information presented in your applications. Newspaper articles, blog posts, press releases, and their associated images and attachments. The Contents section is where the management of your content happens as well as a search utility for quickly accessing your assets.

Digital Assets::
Digital Assets are the rich media files you can use to provide a more robust experience in your application, including photos, audio and video files, and documentation. By using the Digital Assets section, you create a repository from which you can access any asset with minimal effort, can repurpose it in multiple locations, and specify user and management rights to that asset.
+
The Entando platform divides Digital Assets into two broad categories: Images (jpg/jpeg and png files) and Attachments (all other file formats).

Content Types::
Entando's Content Types define the different content elements in your repository and enable you to manage settings for each category in centralized, reusable way. Each type defines the unique attributes associated with that given type through a series of attributes.

Content Models::
Content Models are templates for your information. They determine a structure for how the content is organized, similar to file templates in Microsoft Word or PowerPoint.

Content Settings::
Content Settings provide a method for managing aspects of your Digital Assets such as metadata as well as activating or deactivating Entando's WYSIWYG editor called CKEditor.

=== CONTENTS SECTION

.To add new content:

. Click the *Add* button and select the <<bookmark-contenttypes,Content Type>> to create. +
image::cms_add_content.png[]
. Populate each field with the requisite information. See <<ownjoingroups,Creating a New Page>> for specifics on Owner Groups and Join Groups. When each field is complete, click *Save*.
. Once created, you content appears in the table of results at the bottom of the Content List page. You can edit or copy and paste the content through the menu under the _Actions_ column.

.Publishing and unpublishing content:
You must publish your content in the CMS before you can display it in an application, and you can unpublish it to remove it from display. To publish or unpublish content:

. Select the checkbox next to the requisite content item. You may select multiple content items at once.
. Above the content table, click either the *Approve the content* or *Unpublish* button.

==== anchor:bookmark-content_metadata[]ADDING IMAGES AND TAGS
You can add images from the <<bookmark-digitalassets,Digital Assets>> repository to content. When you do, the image comes with five image tags:

* Text
* Alt
* Description
* Legend
* Title

You have the option to manually assign values to these tags or automatically populate them with metadata values.

.anchor:bookmark-manual_metadata[]To manually assign values:
. Add a new content or select a content from the table and click *Actions* > Edit.
. Click the *Picture* button and select the Digital Asset to include.
. Populate the image tags with values and then click *Save*.

.To autopopulate image tags with metadata:
. Select Apps > CMS > Content Settings.
. In the Resource Metadata Mapping section, populate any of the fields with the value in the Name column of the Metadata table. You can add multiple values by separating them with commas.
+
For example, enter “Detected File Type,Compression Type” in the Alt field to instruct Entando to use those values in the image’s Alt tag. +

=== anchor:bookmark-digitalassets[]DIGITAL ASSETS
The Digital Assets section separates content into Images and Attachments via tabs along the top of the Digital Assets home screen.

.To add digital assets:

. Choose the _Images_ or _Attachments_ tab at the top of the screen, depending on the asset to upload, and click *Add*. +
image::cms_digital_assets.png[]
. Select a Group and home category, and name the asset.
. Click the *Choose File* button to select the file to add to the CMS.
. Click *Done*. The asset appears in the asset list at the bottom of the List of Images or Attachments screen.

==== EDITING ASSETS
Once you have a digital asset in place, you have several editing and viewing options. Click the asset's *More Actions* button and select "Edit" to update the asset's name, location, and the file represented.

==== WORKING WITH AN ASSET'S METADATA
Starting with Entando 4.3.4, the platform has captured metadata for every image you have uploaded. View the metadata from the Images tab of the Digital Assets screen by clicking an asset's *Actions* menu > Edit. The metadata appears in a table at the bottom of the screen.

See the <<bookmark-content_metadata,Adding Images and Tags>> section for details on using image metadata in contents.

==== CROPPING IMAGES
Beginning with Entando 4.3.5, you can crop images newly uploaded via Digital Assets. You can either crop the image dynamically or by using pre-configured crop ratios.

.To set pre-configured crop ratios:

. Select Apps > CMS > Content Settings.
. Under “Settings Image Crop Dimensions,” click *Add*.
. Enter a crop ratio, using numeric values separated by a colon. See the screenshot below for an example.
. Click *Save*.

.To dynamically crop an image:
. Uploading an image to digital assets opens the Edit Image screen with tools to crop the image.
** Buttons representing your pre-defined crop ratios are below the image. Clicking any of those buttons changes the selected crop area based on the chosen ratio.
** You can create multiple crops of a single image as part of the upload process. The right side of the screen displays the list of crops created during the current session. +
image::cms_more_cropping.png[]
. Use your mouse or the buttons below the image to move or change the crop area, then click *Save* to crop the selected area. Repeat the process as many times as needed. Each new crop of the image appears under the List of Images to the right of the screen.
* Click *Close* to return to the Add Digital Assets screen. Notice that each individual crop of the image now has its own row in the list of resources, as well as a *More Actions* button you can use to edit or delete the image.

Click *Done* to exit the Edit screen.

=== anchor:bookmark-contenttypes[]CONTENT TYPES
Content Types determine the fields that differentiate one piece of content, such as a blog post, from another, like an employee profile.

.To create a content type:

. Navigate to APPS > CMS > Content Types and click the *Add* button.
. Assign a Code for the type and then a Name, again, such as blog post or employee profile.
. In the Attributes section, select from the Type drop-down menu an attribute that is necessary to include with this type of content. For example, a blog post would require fields such as Author, Title (text), Timestamp, and Picture (Image). Click the *Add* button to add the attribute to your content type.
. In the Add Attribute screen, enter code and name values for this attribute. The remaining fields on the screen are optional. When finished, click *Continue* to return to the Add screen.
. Add as many additional attributes as necessary and then click *Save*. The content type will appear in the table at the top of the Content Types screen.

To edit a content type, click the *Actions* menu in-line with a content type and select "Edit."

=== anchor:bookmark-contentmodels[]CONTENT MODELS
Content models determine how the CMS arranges your content. The Model section defines the structural layout while any stylesheet that you attach handles the design elements like font, color, and link styles.

.To create a content model:

. Navigate to APPS > CMS > Content Models and click the *Add* button.
. Select the Content Type that this model applies to, then enter identifiers in the Name and Code fields. Selecting the Content Type helps the Inline Editing feature suggest attributes that are available to arrange. For example, if your Blog Post content type contains attributes for Title, Picture, and Caption, the Inline Editor will be able to suggest those attributes as you enter code into the Model field.
. Enter code into the Model field. Entando uses Apache Velocity as its template engine to reference objects in Java code. If you've selected a Content Type, the Inline Editing Assist will format the code for easier reading. +

=== anchor:bookmark-contentsettings[]CONTENT SETTINGS
The Content Settings section is for fine tuning contents that you have added from the Digital Assets section. You can perform tasks such as autopopulating or excluding metadata for images, or adding and removing metadata fields in the Content Settings section.

==== AUTOPOPULATING IMAGE TAGS
You can also <<bookmark-manual_metadata,manually adjust metadata>> for an image in the Contents section.

.To autopopulate image tags:

. Select Apps > CMS > Content Settings.
. In the Resource Metadata Mapping section, populate any of the fields with the value in the Name column of the Metadata table. You can add multiple values by separating them with commas. +
+
For example, enter “Detected File Type,Compression Type” in the Alt field to instruct Entando to use those values in the image’s alt tag.

==== EXCLUDING METADATA
You can exclude metadata fields by name by setting the following property in systemParams.properties:
`jacms.imgMetadata.ignoreKeys`

For example: +
`jacms.imgMetadata.ignoreKeys=Blue TRC,Red TRC,Green TRC`

==== ADDING AND REMOVING METADATA FIELDS
You can customize the metadata fields displayed in the Resource Metadata Mapping section. By default, the values are Alt, Description, Legend, and Title, but you can add and remove fields.

.To add new metadata fields:
. Enter values in the Key and Mapping fields in line with the “Add metadata” field. The Key field represents the metadata’s name (e.g., Alt or Title). The Mapping field defines the value that populates the field.
. Click *Add*. You can add as many new metadata fields as necessary.

.To remove a metadata field:
. Click the *Delete* button in line with the field to remove. +
+
CAUTION: You do not receive a warning before deleting the field and it is not recoverable.
