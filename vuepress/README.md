# Entando Docs (Vuepress)

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### To check internal links in markdown files
```
yarn docs:check-md
```

### To view docs locally
```
yarn docs:dev
```

### Compiles and generates output files in `.vuepress/dist`
```
yarn docs:build
```

## Contributing
All the docs are markdown files. To add a new documentation file, create a folder in `docs`, then create a markdown file (i.e. `README.md`) in it. Or, you can just add it to an existing related folder.

### Sidebar Configuration
After creating a documentation file, it can then be added to the sidebar. To add it, modify `themeConfig.sidebar` in `docs/.vuepress/config.js`. Each folder in `docs` corresponds to a sidebar element, and the markdown files correspond to the element's `children`. For example, the sidebar config for the `docs/blueprint` folder looks like:

```js
  {
    title: 'Blueprint',
    children: [
        '/blueprint/create-plugin-blueprint'
    ]
  }
```

The `children` elements should match the markdown files names, except when it's named `README.md`, which corresponds to the folder name with a trailing slash (i.e. `/blueprint/`).

### Step by Step Guide
As an example, we'll be adding 2 related documentation files, named `README` and `installing-sample-plugin`.

1. Create the folder `docs/sample-plugin`.
2. Create the files `README.md` and `installing-sample-plugin.md` in `docs/sample-plugin`.
3. Open `docs/.vuepress/config.js` and add this to the `sidebar` array:
```js
  {
    title: 'Sample Plugin',
    path: '/sample-plugin/',
    children: [
      '/sample-plugin/',
      '/sample-plugin/installing-sample-plugin'
    ]
  }
```
4. Save it then run `yarn docs:dev` to view the docs in your browser (defaults to `localhost:8080`).
5. Build and generate the output html and assets by running `yarn docs:build`. It generates the files in `docs/.vuepress/dist/`, which is the one that's going to be deployed to a server.

### Versions
We have a simple versioning system in place currently. Creating a new version involves the following steps:
1. Copy the directories with the current version (e.g. `next`) to a new version (e.g. `v6.x`).
   1. Remove any frontmatter redirectFrom attributes that redirect from old /next paths
   2. Modify the top-level pages to remove the warnings, e.g. `v6.x/docs/README.md` and `v6.x/tutorials/README.md` 
1. Copy the `.vuepress/next.js` navigation file to the new version `.vuepress/v6.x`
1. Modify `.vuepress/config.js` 
   1. Add the `require` statement at the top for the new navigation file
   2. Add the new version to the menu.
   3. Add sidebars for the new version.
1. At launch time:
   1. Modify the 3 manual redirect pages under `docs`, `docs/getting-started` and `tutorials` to point to the now active version
   2. Update `SpecialLayout.vue` to point to the new active version of `Docs` and `Tutorials` 
   3. Modify the deploy-staging.sh to use the new active version. Staging will fail to work with the new active version otherwise.
1. Modify Getting Started guide (top-level page, docs/getting-started and quick reference) to update references to jhipster, etc. to point to the appropriate build or package versions.
1. Search for `/next` and `/v6.(x-1)` references in the new v6.x docs. If common practices have been followed, all docs should be using relative references so this should result in no additional changes.
1. Run `yarn docs:check-md` to check for broken links.

### Publishing
We have two utility scripts used to publish the docs to staging and publishing, `vuepress/deploy-staging.sh` and `vuepress/deploy-prod.sh`, respectively. 
   - `deploy-staging.sh` sends files to a Github Pages site available at <https://entando.github.io/entando-docs/> and the script runs with no commands. You should notify the team via slack when updating staging.
   - `deploy-prod.sh` sends files to a Github Pages site available at <https://dev.entando.org> and the script runs with two commands - the target branch and a comment which should include the list of ticket numbers included in the publish.
   - Both scripts use a Vuepress-typical force-push. You'll need privileges on the corresponding repository and/or branch to complete the publish.
   - After running `deploy-prod.sh` you should tag the current commit with the current date. This will make it easier to rollback to a previous publish if there are issues. 

### Tips
* Run `yarn docs:check-md` before submitting a PR. This will verify internal links are functional.
  -  For a more complete link check consider running a full link checker scan (e.g. via deadlinkchecker.com) against staging or prod. This has been done for major docs releases.
* When referencing a single file, please use `.md` rather than `.html`, per Vuepress guidelines.
* Internal links should use relative paths, e.g. `./getting-started/` rather than 
`/v6.2/docs/getting-started/`. This simplifies creating a new version of the documents by copying the current version's docs and tutorials into a new directory.
* If you rename an existing file, please consider adding a frontmatter redirect so old links continue to work, courtesy <https://github.com/ttskch/vuepress-plugin-redirect-frontmatter>
```

redirectFrom: /old-permalink

```
* Run `yarn docs:sync62` to sync `docs/next` to `docs/v6.2` and avoid manually copying more files than needed. This uses rsync and you'll need to compare the differences, especially for top-level files, to make sure no post-6.2 changes get synced into the 6.2 version. You can accomplish the same thing by directly calling rsync:
```
rsync -av --delete --exclude 'docs/README.md' --exclude 'tutorials/README.md' docs/next/ docs/v6.2/
```
