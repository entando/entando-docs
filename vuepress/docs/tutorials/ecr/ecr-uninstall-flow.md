# Bundle uninstall

## Uninstall process
To uninstall a bundle that was previously installed on an Entando App Engine, from Entando App builder UI go to 
the **Component Repository** tab and select the bundle you want to uninstall

![Uninstall flow](./img/uninstall-bundle.png)

An initial check is made to verify none of the bundle components are in use. 
If any of the components are in use, a popup will alert you. 
Note that you can't force the removal of a bundle if its components are in use.

Once the removal process starts:

- Bundle resources are deleted from the Entando App Engine
- Components included in the bundle are removed from the Entando App Engine
- Plugins are unlinked

## Troubleshooting
If any error happens during the uninstall process and you don't know what to do, 
check out the [Troubleshooting guide](./ecr-troubleshooting-guide.md) or the [Entando Forum](https://forum.entando.org)
