# Tutorials 

::: tip Entando simplifies the development of modern apps:

1. Built using modern JavaScript frameworks
2. Backed by microservices deployed in containers, and
3. Orchestrated by Kubernetes for fully automated DevOps lifecycles
:::

Entando supports full stack micro frontend and microservice architectures for codebases that are easier to undestand, maintain, and debug across large, distributed teams, and comes with a private component repository that makes it easy for teams to share and reuse components.
