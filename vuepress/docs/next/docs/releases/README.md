## KEY OPEN ISSUES

### Keycloak RCE

The keycloak version used by Entando is vulnerable ([https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/7138](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/7138)).

A fixed version of keycloak has not yet been released. [update: a fixed keycloak has been released and will be included in the next version of Entando]

The vulnerability can be exploited only if you have a way to obtain valid token (so a valid username/password)

An update is underway and will be soon released.

## OTHER OPEN ISSUES

* In AppBuilder the user is unable to set its personal profile data from the MyProfile screen

* In the contents widgets some built-In content types misbehave if Content Template = Default. Users need to explicitly select the Content Template.

* In AppBuilder, assets management , deleting a duplicate image causes the deletion of the original image

* AppBuilder UX/UI is still sometimes not consistent

* The Entando Component Generator still doesnâ€™t support generation of microservices with no backend

* Support of old versions of Oracle not complete yet

* Documentation has been improved but needs further work
