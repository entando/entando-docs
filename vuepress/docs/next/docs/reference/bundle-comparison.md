# Bundle Evolution on Entando 7

Entando 7.1 introduced a more modular approach to building apps with the **ent bundle CLI** orchestrating the management of bundle project. The Entando Bundle was restructured, its processes decoupled by component type, and the publishing transport method streamlined. With these changes, Entando Bundles went from git-based to docker-based OCI bundles. This page clarifies the differences between the two although git-based bundles are deprecated with Entando 7.2.

For instructions on converting a git-based bundle to a docker-based bundle, see the [Convert Bundle tutorial](./convert-bundle.md). 

With Entando 7.3, the bundle has advanced further with descriptorVersion v6, adding the capability to request resources for storage, memory and CPU for microservices in the bundle descriptor `entando.json`. For more information on this specification or docker-based bundles, see the [Bundle Details](../curate/bundle-details.md) page. 

### Bundle Comparison Table
|Property| [git-based bundles](../../../v7.0/docs/curate/ecr-bundle-details.md)| [docker-based bundles](../curate/bundle-details.md)|
| :- | :-------------------- | :---------------------  |
|`descriptorVersion`| v1| v5
| Bundle Specifications |Defined with descriptor files | Built with [ent bundle CLI](../getting-started/ent-bundle.md) tool
| Versioning |Bundle version set by Git tags |Bundle version set by Docker tags. For MFEs, the version defaults to 1.0.0 unless set in the [entando.json](../curate/bundle-details.md)
|Plugin Ingress| Generated by Entando or set in the plugin descriptor.yaml | Generated by Entando or customized in the [bundle descriptor](../curate/bundle-details.md#entando-bundle-conventions), entando.json
|Identifiers| Designated Bundle ID and Plugin ID | Bundles, MFEs, & plugins have unique global IDs|
|Bundle ID| Not included in component names | Suffix of bundle, plugin, widget, page and fragment names
|Initialize from Entando Hub| As git clone  |[Direct initialization from Hub](../getting-started/ent-bundle.md#initialization) with `â€“from-hub` flag|
|Bundle Creation | [`ent prj` commands](../getting-started/ent-bundle.md#git-based-bundle-commands)| New modular [`ent bundle` commands](../getting-started/ent-bundle.md)
|Deploy and Install| `ent ecr deploy` and `ent ecr install` | No change 
|Export Bundle|`ent bundler`| Not Available 
|JHipster Integrated Blueprint Project| `ent jhipster blueprint` creates [MFE & MS template project](../../tutorials/create/ms/generate-microservices-and-micro-frontends.md)| [Convert blueprint project to v5 bundle](../../tutorials/create/ms/generate-microservices-and-micro-frontends.md) <!-- TODO-change link to new tutorial -->
|API Claims| Manual configuration in MFE bundle | [Manage APIs with `ent bundle` commands](../getting-started/ent-api.md). Micro frontends can make API claims to microservices within the same bundle or namespace
|Local Services |Blueprint includes a few services under src/main/docker | Default services now include Keycloak, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. Additional services can be added with the [`ent bundle svc` commands](../getting-started/ent-svc.md)
|MFE Custom UI| Add with manual scripts| Custom UI is auto-generated in FTL format
|| | Auto-generated FTLs with parameters defined in entando.json |
|Bundle Thumbnail| Detailed inside the YAML bundle descriptor| Set with a JPG or PNG file named `thumbnail` in the bundle root folder, e.g. thumbnail.png
