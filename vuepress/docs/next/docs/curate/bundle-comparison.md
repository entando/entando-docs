# Bundle Evolution on Entando 7.1

Entando 7.1 implements a more modular approach to building apps with the **ent bundle CLI** orchestrating the management of project bundles. The Entando Bundle was restructured, its processes decoupled by component type, and the publishing transport method was streamlined. With these changes, Entando Bundles went from git-based to docker-based OCI bundles. Both types are supported on Entando 7.1, and this page clarifies the differences between the two, along with the improvements in the new release.

Some of the major improvements with docker-based bundles are:
* Simplified bundle directory structure
* Just one Git source repository required with Docker image repositories created automatically as needed
* Optimized file storage and transfer using a layered file system, beneficial for large projects
* Standardized bundle address format
* A decoupled build and deployment process which is easier to understand, modify, and troubleshoot 

For specifications on docker-based bundles, see the [Bundle Details](bundle-details.md) page. 
### Bundle Comparison Table
|Attribute| [git-based bundles](../../../v7.0/docs/curate/ecr-bundle-details.md)| [docker-based bundles](bundle-details.md)|
| :- | :-------------------- | :---------------------  |
|`descriptorVersion`| v1| v5
| Bundle specifications |Defined with descriptor files | Built with [ent bundle CLI](../getting-started/ent-bundle.md) tool
| Versioning |Bundle version set by Git tags |Bundle version set by Docker tags. For MFEs, the version defaults to 1.0.0 unless set in the [entando.json](bundle-details.md)
|Plugin ingress| Generated by Entando or set in the plugin descriptor.yaml | Generated by Entando or customized in the [bundle descriptor](bundle-details.md#entando-bundle-conventions), entando.json
|Identifiers| Designated Bundle ID and Plugin ID | Bundles, MFEs, & plugins have unique global IDs|
|Bundle ID| Not included in component names | Suffix of bundle, plugin, widget, page and fragment names
|Initialize from Entando Hub| As git clone  |[Direct initialization from Hub](../getting-started/ent-bundle.md#initialization) with `â€“from-hub` flag|
|Bundle creation | [`ent prj` commands](../getting-started/ent-bundle.md#git-based-bundle-commands)| New modular [`ent bundle` commands](../getting-started/ent-bundle.md)

|API claims| Manual configuration in MFE bundle | [Manage APIs with `ent bundle` commands](../getting-started/ent-api.md). Micro frontends can make API claims to microservices within the same bundle or namespace
|Local services |Blueprint includes a few services under src/main/docker | Default services now include Keycloak, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. Additional services can be added with the [`ent bundle svc` commands](../getting-started/ent-svc.md)
