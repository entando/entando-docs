The Welcome Wizard is activated and displayed when you first log in to the App Builder. It provides a guided tour of how to begin creating your application. 

If you need to review it at any time, click on the information icon in the top navigation bar, then select `Start Welcome Wizard`. You can slso disable it by checking `Don't show next time` in the popup window, or by going to `My Profile` â†’ `Preferences` and setting the `Welcome Wizard` preference to `Off`.

The Wizard will guide you through the key steps in designing and publishing a page for your application. It looks something like this:
1. Create a Page by setting its title, code, location, group, and template.
2. Design the Page by placing a set of pre-configured components on the page.
3. Preview the Page
4. Publish the Page
