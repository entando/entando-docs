# Entando Solution Templates 

The Entando Application Composition Platform offers several Solution Templates to demonstrate various business capabilities and integrations:

- [**Entando Customer Portal**](../../tutorials/solution/customer-portal.md)
- [**Entando Hub**](../../tutorials/solution/entando-hub.md)
- [**Entando Process Driven Applications Plugin**](../../tutorials/solution/pda-tutorial.md)
- [**Entando Standard Banking Demo**](../../tutorials/solution/install-standard-demo.md)

Each open source Solution Template was built with Entando and can be used as-is, reviewed for common development practices, or leveraged as a useful starting point for a related application. 

The following Solution Templates and other sets of components are available in the [public Entando Hub](https://hub.entando.com) for installation in a user environment, where turnkey functionality can be customized and extended.

## Entando Customer Portal

The [Entando Customer Portal](../../tutorials/solution/customer-portal.md) streamlines development of a customer-facing, self-service subscription management application. The Platform integrates Keycloak role based access control and Jira Service Management as a ticket tracking system.
