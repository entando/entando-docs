# Entando Customer Portal 
## Overview
The Entando Customer Portal enables an organization to quickly provide a modern, self-service customer-facing application for management of subscriptions. It includes a lightweight integration to Jira Service Management for access to service tickets and a Role Based Access Control (RBAC) design for granting users varying levels of access.

Key Features:

* Customizable service ticket and tracking system with Jira Service Management
* Role based access control (RBAC) with Entando Identity Management System
* Integrated user, customer, project, and subscription management

5. [Using the Customer Portal](#using-the-customer-portal)
6. [Resources](#resources)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
* A working instance of Entando running on Kubernetes. See [Getting Started](../../docs/getting-started/) for more information or [install Entando on any Kubernetes provider](../#operations). 
* Use the Entando CLI command `ent check-env develop` to verify all dependencies.
* A Jira Service Management account.

### Automatic Install with Entando App Builder
Install the Customer Portal in two simple steps by integrating the Entando Hub into your App Builder. 
1. From your App Builder, go to the `Repository` from the sidebar. Select `Entando Hub` at the top right side of the page if it has already been configured. If it has not been configured, enter Entando Hub and the API URL to initialize the Hub.

2. Deploy and `Install` the two Customer Portal bundles from the Catalog. 

3. To navigate to your Portal: 
   * From the sidebar →  `Page` → `Management` 
   * Find the `Customer Portal` page
   * From the `Actions` pull-down menu →  `View Published Page`

### Manual Install 
1. To install the Customer Portal, run the following commands in the order listed. Edit the `-n entando` option for each command to match your namespace or project.

``` bash
ent bundler from-git -r https://github.com/nshaw/customerportal-wip-bundle.git -d | ent kubectl apply -n entando -f - 
```

``` bash
ent bundler from-git -r https://github.com/nshaw/customerportal-content-bundle.git -d | ent kubectl apply -n entando -f - 
```
2. Log into the App Builder.

3. Go to `Repository` from the left navigation bar. Two Customer Portal bundles will be visible there. `Install` the latest version of both bundles.

4. To navigate to your Portal: 
   * From the sidebar →  `Page` → `Management` 
   * Find the `Customer Portal` page
   * From the `Actions` pull-down menu →  `View Published Page`

## Configuration
### Administrators
In order to configure the Customer Portal and its users, the administrator will need Jira Service Management and Entando Identity Management System credentials. The administrator can create and configure users and groups, assign roles and projects, and track service tickets.  They can also customize the ticketing system. 

::: tip Notes:
* The built-in mapper for email must be enabled on the server client so that user accounts can be retrieved from Jira and new tickets can use that account information.

* Use the cp_admin_config.page to configure the Customer Portal to connect to Jira Service Management. 

* Configure the Customer Portal to accomodate a specific Jira Service Management instance.
::: 

### Jira Service Management 

The administrator utilizes Jira Service Management to create users, projects, define the organization, and configure the service ticket system.

Users who need access to the Customer Portal, beyond subscription and project information, must have a Jira Service Management account.

1. Go to Customers to add organizations and projects. Once added, click on the name of the organization to get the ID, needed later, from the URL. \
 e.g. example.com/jira/servicedesk/projects/ECS/organization/3 → the organization ID is “3”

### Entando Identity Management System 
Logging into the Entando Identity Management System, you will see the landing page shown below. Like the App Builder, the left navigation bar is your guide for managing users, groups, and most importantly, roles. Using the RBAC model, define what access users have by the roles and groups they are assigned. Some important guidelines are noted below. 

![Entando Identity Management System](./images/cp-idmanagement-main.png)

* **Define the Realm Setting**. \
The `Realm` is a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. A user belongs to and logs into a `Realm`. 

* **Create Roles**\
You can use the default roles by clicking on `Client Roles` and choosing `entandodemo-customerportal-server`. Access for each role is defined as follows:
    * `cp-customer` -  assigned directly to specific projects for a single customer
    * `cp-partner` - assigned directly to specific projects for multiple customers
    * `cp-support` -  read only view of all customer projects
    * `cp-admin` - admin access for the Customer Portal

* **Create New Users**: 
     1. From the sidebar, go to `Users`. Click `Add User` at right.
     2. Complete the form as needed but note the requirements for these fields:\
       `Username`: a unique name\
       `Email`: must use the same address used in Jira\
       `User Enabled` → On\
     `Save`

     3. Send an email to the user to activate their account and set a new password: \
     Go to `Credentials` header. \
     Under `Credential Reset`, in the `Reset Actions` → `Update Password`.  \
     Click `Send Email`. \

     4. Go to Role Mapping. \
     Select the appropriate roles from `Available Roles` and click `Add Selected` to assign. 
     * Choose `entandodemo-customerportal-server` from the `Client Roles` pull-down menu to use the default roles. 
     * A full administrative user will need `realm-admin` role under `realm-management` Client Roles in order to manage users in the Portal. 
     * Check the `Effective Roles` column on right to ensure the correct roles have been assigned.

  5. Under `Groups`, assign roles to groups as needed. Roles are additive.



## Managing the Customer Portal

As administrator for the Customer Portal, you can create and manage: users, customers, projects, and subscriptions. You can also assign projects to users who have activated their account on Jira and have been assigned roles in the Entando Identity Management System. 

The administrator needs a Jira account and the appropriate role assignment in the Entando Identity Management System as well.

* **Create a Customer or Partner**\
Creating a `Customer` or `Partner` is a similar process. Below are the steps for adding a `Customer`. Please follow the same procedure for adding a `Partner`.
1. Click `Add a Customer`
2. Fill in the details. Note the following:
     * The `Customer Number` must be unique 
     * The `Notes` field is visible only to Support and Admin users 

 ![Customer Portal Add Customer](./images/cp-add-customer.png)   

* **Create & Assign Projects**
1. From the landing page, click on any customer to see the associated project list.
2. To create a new project, click `Add a Project`
    * Enter the `Project` information
    * Provide the Organization ID from Jira. Each project must have a unique Organization ID.
    * Click `Save`
3. To assign `Projects`:
	* Use the drop-down menu under `Action` on the right → `Manage Users`
    * Select the user for the `Project`  → `Submit` 
    
* **Manage Partners and Subscriptions** \
Use the drop-down menu under `Action` to manage Partners, and request and manage subscriptions. 

## Using the Customer Portal

Customer Portal users need access provided by your organization administrator. You can request and track subscriptions as well as create and track service tickets.

Once you login to the Customer Portal, you will see a list of customers. Click on any customer to see their details and track their projects.

1. To create a `Service Ticket` for a project, use the `Action` pull-down menu  → `Open Ticket`
