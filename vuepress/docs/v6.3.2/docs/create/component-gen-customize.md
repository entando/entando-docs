# Customizing the Entando Component Generator

The Entando Component Generator is an instance of a JHipster blueprint that can be extended to match your team's needs and requirements. If you're interested in extending the blueprint or creating your own blueprint, contact us on the [Entando Forum](https://forum.entando.org/) or [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/entandocommunity/shared_invite/zt-g609owdv-2K~YRh8zrI6lqlWo4aFWUw) and we'll help you get started.

The source for the Entando blueprint can be found [here](https://github.com/entando/entando-blueprint).

To learn more about creating blueprints and to see other blueprints available from JHipster checkout the [blueprint documentation](https://www.jhipster.tech/modules/creating-a-blueprint/) or visit [JHipster](https://wwww.jhipster.tech) for an overview.
