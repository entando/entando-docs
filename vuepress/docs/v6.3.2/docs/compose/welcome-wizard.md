# Welcome Wizard

The Welcome Wizard is displayed when you first log in to the Application Builder. You can also start it later by going to the top navigation bar in the Application Builder, click on the information icon, and click `Begin Welcome Wizard`. You can disable it from the wizard popup by selecting `Don't show next time` and then `Close`, or by going to `My Profile → Preferences` and setting the `Welcome Wizard` preference to `Off`.

The Wizard will guide you through the key steps in designing and publishing a page in your application:
1. Create a Page by setting its title, code, location, group, and template.
2. Design the Page by placing a set of pre-configured widgets on the page.
3. Preview the Page
4. Publish the Page
