## Finding Content

You can list specific Content by using the filters:

    Approved/Published)

-   **Pending Changes**: All created Content that was saved by only clicking on the
    **Save** or **Save and Continue** button. The content is not
    approved and therefore is not ready to be published.

-   **Ready for Approval**: All created Content that is in **Ready** status,
    and saved by clicking on the **Save** or **Save and Continue** button.
    The content is ready for review but has not yet been approved and

    by clicking on the **Save and Approve** button. This content has been
    published.
