# Content Types

## Objective

This document provides an overview of the Content Types, as well as how
they are created and represented.

## Overview

The Content Type is a construct used to represent or to model a Content.
It is characterized by a set of Attribute Types[1] , each of which
defines the value of their properties, called attributes. A Content is
an instance or specialization of the Content Type.

through the Web CMS, its user interface is made available in the App
Builder application.
