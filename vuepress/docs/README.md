# Entando Platform

Entando is a **micro frontend platform for Kubernetes** that helps enterprises innovate faster with parallel development teams that have end-to-end autonomy across the entire stack.

With native support for Javascript app development, a micro frontend and microservices architecture, deployment of apps in containers that can be individually scaled up and down, and automated management of containers with Kubernetes, we simplify the move for enterprises looking to modernize across on-prem and cloud infrastructures.

## Entando Architecture

![entando-architecture](./entando-architecture.png)

The platform comes with the:

- `Entando App Engine` that wires micro frontends & microservices and composes them on a page.
- `Entando App Builder`, the user interface to build and design applications.
- `Entando Component Generator` that provides advanced data modeling capabilities and automatically generates the corresponding microservices and micro frontends.
- `Entando Component Repository`, a shared, internal repository for your company.
- `Entando Identity Management` for providing token-based authentication across multiple security domains and connecting multiple service providers with different identity providers.
- `Entando WCMS`, a web content management system for building applications with headless CMS.
- `Entando Business Automation Bundle` for powerful business automation capabilities with out of the box support for Red Hat Process Automation Manager.

## Why Kubernetes?

Instead of you doing the work to ensure your apps and services stay up and running, Kubernetes does the work for you. For each app or service, you can set resource limits, the number of pods you want backing each service, upgrade strategy, and auto-scaling. Kubernetes actively manages your cluster to match your defined resource utilization and ensures your site doesn't go down.

::: tip How Google Runs Containers in Production
Each week, Google deploys over 2 billion containers in production to run all of its services like Gmail, YouTube, and Search. Kubernetes is Google's open source solution to automate the management of containers at scale.
:::

Over 50% of Fortune 500 companies use Kubernetes with product offerings from Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Cloud Platform (GKE), IBM (Red Hat) OpenShift, Microsoft Azure (AKS), and VMWare Pivotal (PKS).

## Install Kubernetes

Since Entando is designed to run on Kubernetes, let's get started by installing our own instance of Kubernetes locally.

We've tested a variety of Kubernetes implementations including Minikube, Minishift, CodeReady Containers, K3s, and Microk8s to find the best combination of low cpu/memory usage, fast startup times, and minimal configuration so we can get started quickly. After downloading the necessary files, we'll have our own instance of Kubernetes up and running in < 60 seconds.

::: tip What's Needed to Run Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a container orchestrator designed to manage a server cluster. It requires at least one master node running a Linux OS. We'll be using Multipass to create a lightweight Ubuntu VM in seconds that runs on a bare metal hypervisor for speed and performance.
:::

### Hypervisors
::: tip
Hypervisors allow you to create and run virtual machines. Virtualization software that run on top of your OS like VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation are Type 2 hypervisors. Type 1 hypervisors run on bare metal.
:::

Let's install a type 1 hypervisor for optimal performance:

- **Mac:** Install hyperkit.

``` bash
brew install hyperkit
```

- **Windows:** Install Hyper-V.

[Install Hyper-V on Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v?redirectedfrom=MSDN)

*For machines that don't support a Type 1 hypervisor, install VirtualBox.*
[Mac](https://multipass.run/docs/installing-on-macos)
[Windows](https://multipass.run/docs/installing-on-windows)

### Lighweight, Ubuntu VM

::: tip
Multipass is a tool developed by the publishers of Ubuntu to create lightweight Ubuntu VMs in seconds.
:::

1. Install [Multipass](https://multipass.run/#install)

2. Launch VM

``` bash
multipass launch --name ubuntu-lts --cpus 4 --mem 8G --disk 20G
```

3. Open a shell

``` bash
multipass shell ubuntu-lts
```

### Lightweight Kubernetes

::: tip
K3s is a certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in resource-constrained environments.

It's packaged as a single <40MB binary that reduces the dependencies and steps needed to install, run and auto-update a production Kubernetes cluster.
:::

1. Install k3s

``` bash
sudo curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

2. Check for `Ready` `STATUS`.

``` bash
sudo kubectl get node
```

*Optional:* See what's running out of the box

``` bash
sudo kubectl get pods -A
```

::: tip Congratulations!
You now have a local instance of Kubernetes up and running.

## Install Entando

Entando is a platform that helps developers create apps as containerized micro frontends and microservices on Kubernetes. It comes with its own cluster infrastructure to wire micro frontends and microservices together, a shared component repository, an identity management system, a web content management system, and business automation to make it easier for you to create apps for your end users.

To install Entando, we'll define custom resources inside of Kubernetes, and then create a Kubernetes `Deployment` to deploy the platform. Default resources in Kubernetes include Pods, Services, and Ingresses. We'll be adding custom resources like the Entando App, Entando plugins, database servers, and identity management servers.

### Entando Custom Resources

Install Entando Custom Resource Definitions.

From your Ubuntu shell:

1. Download custom resource definitions.

``` bash
wget -c https://es-entando.github.io/custom-resources.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz
```

2. Create custom resource definitions

``` bash
sudo kubectl create -f custom-resources
```

### Kubernetes Namespace

::: tip
Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces. [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)

You can use namespaces to allocate resources and set cpu/memory limits for individual projects or teams. They also can be helpful to further encapsulate projects from one another.
:::

``` bash
sudo kubectl create namespace entando
```

### Download Helm Chart

::: tip
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you define, install, and upgrade Kubernetes applications.
:::

#### Entando Platform

If this is your first time trying out Entando, use `entando.yaml` for a faster install.
*Note: These files don't work out of the box with openshift. You can generate an openshift compatible version of entando using the quickstart project available at https://github.com/entando-k8s/entando-helm-quickstart*

``` bash
wget https://docs.entando.com/docs/assets/yaml/entando.yaml
```

``` bash
ENTANDO_HELM_CHART=entando.yaml
```

#### Entando Platform Bundled with Process Driven Applications

If you're using Entando for process automation, use `process-automation.yaml`.

``` bash
wget https://docs.entando.com/docs/assets/yaml/process-automation.yaml
```

``` bash
ENTANDO_HELM_CHART=process-automation.yaml
```

### Configure External Access to Your Cluster

::: tip
Entando sets up `Ingresses` in Kubernetes to access services from outside your server cluster. We'll use this to access Entando from our browser.
:::

To set up external access to your cluster, you'll need to replace the value of `ENTANDO_DEFAULT_ROUTING_SUFFIX` with your Ubuntu IP. You can look up your Ubuntu IP, and edit the YAML file manaully, but running the below commands will automatically update the IP address for you without having to open up the file.

*Note: Remember to run the `ENTANDO_HELM_CHART=...` command in the previous step so your shell knows which file to update. You can only choose one of the deployment options, either `entando.yaml` or `process-automation.yaml`.*

``` bash
IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
```

``` bash
sed -i "s/192.168.64.25/$IP/" $ENTANDO_HELM_CHART
```

### Deploy to Kubernetes

Deploying the Helm chart will deploy all of the Kubernetes resources required for Entando to run.

``` bash
sudo kubectl create -f process-automation.yaml
```

``` bash
sudo kubectl get pods -n entando --watch
```

This will take some time so take a short break, and we'll go through everything that was installed once everything's up and running.

<details><summary>Shell Output: kubectl get pods -n entando --watch</Summary>

#### Successful Startup

- First, you'll see the Entando operator: `ContainerCreating` > `Running`
- Next, the Entando composite app deployer: `Pending` > `ContainerCreating` > `Running`
- Then, Keycloak: `kc-deployer` > `kc-db-deployment`

**Jobs / Deployments**
- Jobs, like `kc-db-preparation-job` run once, and are `Completed`: `0/1`
- Database deployments, like `kc-db-deployment`, should end up as `Running`: `1/1`
- Server deployments, like `kc-server-deployment`, should end up as `Running`: `1/1`

**Lifecycle Events**
- Each line represents an event: `Pending`, `ContainerCreating`, `Running` or `Completed`
- Restarts should ideally be `0`; otherwise, there was a problem with your cluster, and Kubernetes is trying to self-heal

## Getting Started

First, let's see what comes out of the box.

``` bash
sudo kubectl get pods -n entando
```

``` shell-session

### Access Entando Servers

Next, let's check out our Ingresses to get the URLs for our server deployments

``` bash
sudo kubectl describe ingress -n entando
```

``` shell-session
Name:             quickstart-kc-ingress
Namespace:        entando
Address:          192.168.64.33
Default backend:  default-http-backend:80 (<none>)
Rules:
  Host                                        Path  Backends
  ----                                        ----  --------
  quickstart-kc-entando.192.168.64.33.nip.io
                                              /auth   quickstart-kc-server-service:8080 (10.42.0.14:8080)
```

The Ingresses provide the `Host` and `Path` to access our servers.

### Identity Management

1. Navigate to Keycloak in your browser

``` shell-session
  Host                                        Path  Backends
  ----                                        ----  --------
  quickstart-kc-entando.192.168.64.33.nip.io
                                              /auth   quickstart-kc-server-service:8080 (10.42.0.14:8080)
```

Example: http://quickstart-kc-entando.192.168.64.33.nip.io/auth/

Replace the first part of the URL with your `Host`

2. Next, get the Kubernetes `Secret` to get the login and password.

``` bash
sudo kubectl get secrets -n entando
```

We're interested in the `keycloak-admin-secret`:

``` shell-session
NAME                                                 TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
quickstart-kc-db-admin-secret                        Opaque                                2      78m
quickstart-kc-db-secret                              Opaque                                2      76m
quickstart-kc-admin-secret                           Opaque                                2      76m
quickstart-kc-realm                                  Opaque                                1      76m
keycloak-admin-secret                                Opaque                                3      70m
```

3. Decode the secret

``` bash
sudo kubectl get secret keycloak-admin-secret -n entando -o go-template=\
"{{println}}Username: {{.data.username | base64decode}}{{println}}Password: {{.data.password | base64decode}}{{println}}{{println}}"
```

``` shell-session
Username: entando_keycloak_admin
Password: MZ8bY4phMd
```

4. In your Keycloak browser, click `Administration Console`

Enter the Username and Password from your shell

#### Configure Client Roles

In this step, we'll configure the required Client Roles to give our user permission to access our pods

1. Click `Users` in the left sidebar

2. Click `View all users`

3. Click on the link next to the `admin` user to select the user

4. Click the `Role Mappings` tab

5. Under the `Client Roles` dropdown:

- Select `quickstart-pda-server`: Add all `Available Roles` to `Assigned Roles`
- Select `quickstart-pda-sidecar`: Add all `Available Roles` to `Assigned Roles`
- Select `quickstart-server`: Add all `Available Roles` to `Assigned Roles`

Your changes are saved automatically

### Entando App Builder

1. Navigate to the Entando App Builder in your browser

``` bash
sudo kubectl describe ingress -n entando

Address:          192.168.64.33
Default backend:  default-http-backend:80 (<none>)
Rules:
  Host                                     Path  Backends
  ----                                     ----  --------
  quickstart-entando.192.168.64.33.nip.io
                                           /entando-de-app     quickstart-server-service:8080 (10.42.0.22:8080)
                                           /digital-exchange   quickstart-server-service:8083 (10.42.0.22:8083)
                                           /app-builder/       quickstart-server-service:8081 (10.42.0.22:8081)
                                           /pda                quickstart-pda-server-service:8081 (10.42.0.28:8081)
```
