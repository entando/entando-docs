title: Why is technical blogging so important?
---

<p>All the learning that we gather together defines our knowledge. And when we put this knowledge into writing, providing direction, instruction, explanation, and empathy, we call it technical blogging.</p>

<p>But, why do we have to do this?</p>

<p>If we look at it from our own perspective, it's really helpful for us to grow as individuals. Documenting our learning process in a particular subject, in one place, in a complete manner is, first of all, self-help! There are two benefits to it:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Our storytelling capability develops and improves with time.</li>
	<li>When we need to work on that particular subject, even after 5 years, the blogs we wrote help us stay up to date on the subject.</li>
</ul>

<p>What, apart from these?</p>

<p>If you are someone who wishes to be around a technical community or a network of people, technical blogging is so your thing!</p>

<p>One technical blog can help many learn and grow, just as you grow personally. After all, we look for blogs when we try to learn something new. So, we can definitely be one of those bloggers whose writings are read by others as they try to learn something new.</p>

<p>But, what if you suffer from imposter syndrome?</p>

<p><em>"What if I am not proficient enough to write a blog? What if I don't have the skills to do it? What if I am not knowledgeable enough?"</em></p>

<p>Well, you don't need to be a pro in order to write a blog. If you're a very keen learner, you can always use your learnings to start writing blogs.</p>

<p>And whatever we learn is our knowledge. Hence, each one of us is absolutely qualified to write technical blogs.</p>

<p>Let's explore a few things we can use as best practices while writing blogs:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Always define key points before starting a blog. (These can also be goal statements.)</li>
	<li>Dedicate each paragraph to a particular topic/area.</li>
	<li>Make sure you are writing with your target audience in mind.</li>
	<li>Create engaging sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to develop interest.</li>
	<li>Break lengthy sentences into shorter ones.</li>
	<li>Break up big ideas into smaller sections, with short paragraphs.</li>
	<li>Use bullet points to explain agendas/steps.</li>
	<li>When working with an in-depth technical subject, use flow diagrams to explain processes.</li>
	<li>Be empathetic while you write. Express how you feel; don't be afraid to show your emotions in the writing. This will keep it from sounding like a dry step-by-step manual.</li>
	<li>Use a tool to check spelling mistakes, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>These are the steps I try to follow when I am writing blogs. The best thing about writing blogs continuously is that your writing improves every time. And that is learning too.</p>

<p>To wrap up, it is not really hard to write a technical blog. The very first thing you really need to do is get started. And slowly, the quality of your writing and content will improve over time. Believe in your capabilities and write everything you can to best explain your content! The blogs you write can help many other people while satisfying your own curiosity and learning goals. It is mutually beneficial, for you and the audience you're writing the blog for.</p>
