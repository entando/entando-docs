# Welcome Wizard

The Welcome Wizard is displayed when you first log in to the Application Builder. You can also start it later by going to the top navigation bar in the Application Builder, click on the information icon, and click `Begin Welcome Wizard`. You can disable it from the wizard popup by selecting `Don't show next time` and then `Close`, or by going to `My Profile â†’ Preferences` and setting the `Welcome Wizard` preference to `Off`.
