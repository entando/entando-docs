# Entando Solution Templates 

The Entando ACP offers several Solution Templates to demonstrate various business capabilities and integrations:

- [**Entando Customer Portal**](../../tutorials/solution/customer-portal.md)
- [**Entando Hub**](../../tutorials/solution/entando-hub.md)
- [**Entando Process Driven Applications Plugin**](../../tutorials/solution/pda-tutorial.md)
- [**Entando Standard Banking Demo**](../../tutorials/solution/install-standard-demo.md)

Each open source template was built with Entando and can be used as-is, reviewed as a reference, customized, or leveraged as a starting point for a similar application. 

These Solution Templates, and other packaged business capabilities (PBCs), are available in the [Entando Marketplace Hub](https://entando.com/composable-platform/packaged-business-capabilities/).
