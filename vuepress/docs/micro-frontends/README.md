# Microfrontends

## Introduction

> The idea behind Micro Frontends is to think about a website or web app
> as **a composition of features** which are owned by **independent
> teams**. Each team has a **distinct area of business** or **mission**
> it cares about and specialises in. A team is **cross functional** and
> develops its features **end-to-end**, from database to user interface.

So, think of microfrontends as the implementation of microservices
concept to a full web app, UI included.

The Entando way to microfrontends is based on [Web
Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components),
a set of technologies that allow developers to create reusable custom
elements supported by all major internet browsers.

Web Components can work with vanilla JS as well as with the most popular
web frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).

That means the Entando platform enables developers work with their
favourite tech stack, and allows companies to quickly evolve their
technology and to always look for best tech talents no matter the
framework they use.

The following tutorials will help you creating Entando Widgets using a
microfrontend-based approach.
