# Entando CLI

## Overview

The Entando Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a set of commands that accelerate common tasks such as installing a new instance of Entando, generating an Entando project via JHipster, deploying an Entando Bundle, creating an Entando Application, etc.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

The basic requirements for the CLI vary depending on the category of developer tasks. The CLI is able to install secondary dependencies using the `ent check-env` command as described [here](#check-the-environment).

| Category | Prerequisite
| :-: | :-:
|Basic Development| Git or [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org)
| Install Entando in a local VM | [Multipass](https://multipass.run/#install)
| Build and publish Entando Bundles | Docker and Docker Compose
| | a Git repository for the bundle artifacts
| | a Docker Hub account (or organization) for microservice Docker images
| Deploy an Entando Bundle | a Kubernetes cluster with admin access, which can be a local cluster (created via the Entando CLI or manually) or a shared remote cluster

::: tip
 The automated option in [Getting Started](../getting-started/) will install the CLI along with an Ubuntu VM containing K3s Kubernetes and a quickstart Entando Application.
:::

### Install the CLI
Install the current offical release of the CLI via the following command
``` bash
curl -L https://get.entando.org/cli | bash
```


### Check the Environment

Use the `check-env` command to prepare your environment for development. This will verify the presence of required dependencies as well as the appropriate versions for your specific Entando instance. Certain configurations allow `check-env` to automatically install dependencies and prompt the developer for guidance or approval as needed. 
``` bash
ent check-env develop
```

### Update the CLI
The CLI can be updated to the latest version (corresponding to the current Entando version) using 

``` sh
bash <(curl -L "https://get.entando.org/cli") --update
```

Run `ent check-env develop` after updating the CLI to determine if dependency versions have changed.

Alternatively, deleting the `~/.entando` directory with `rm -rf ~/.entando` and then reinstalling the CLI, per the instructions above, will perform a clean install. This will also remove the private copies of JHipster, Entando Blueprint, etc.

> ⚠ RECOMMENDED FIRST STEP ⚠ :
  - Check the dependencies (ent check-env --help)
```
Check a command's help text (`--help`) to view specific options and subcommands, e.g. `ent check-env --help`. For general configuration options related to ent itself, see `ent --help`.

### Customize Quickstart
The `ent quickstart` command supports parameters to customize your quickstart environment. These options allow you to modify specific properties of your VM, installation versions and databases.

For example, to reuse an existing VM:
``` sh
ent quickstart --vm-reuse=YOUR-EXISTING-VM
```
For additional information, check the output of
``` sh
ent quickstart --help
```

## Common Operations
### Project Management
Procedures and commands commonly used to generate and manage Entando projects are detailed below. 

#### Project Setup
1. Create a project directory
``` sh
mkdir testProject && cd testProject
```
2. Generate the project skeleton using the JHipster-based Entando Blueprint
``` sh
ent jhipster --blueprints entando
```
3. Generate an entity and MFEs
``` sh
ent jhipster entity Conference
```
4. Build the new project
``` sh
ent prj build
```

> Note: Using the `ent prj` wrapper avoids having to build each part of the project individually. The first run using `ent prj` can be slower due to MFE node downloads. See [the BLueprint tutorial](../../tutorials/create/ms/generate-microservices-and-micro-frontends.md) for more details.

#### Prepare and Publish a Project Bundle
Use the publication system `pbs` to assemble your Entando project into a bundle that can be loaded into Kubernetes. This requires your GitHub credentials, an empty GitHub repository to hold your bundle artifacts, and a Docker Hub account or organization.
1. Initialize the bundle directory. This method accepts SSH and HTTPS URLs.
``` sh
ent prj pbs-init
``` 
2. Publish the build artifacts to GitHub and Docker Hub
``` sh
ent prj pbs-publish
```
3. Deploy the bundle into the Entando Component Repository
``` sh
ent prj deploy
```
See [Build and Publish a Project Bundle](../../tutorials/create/pb/publish-project-bundle.md) for more details.

#### Install the Project Bundle into an Application
The CLI allows you to install a bundle without accessing the Entando App Builder.

> Note: A bundle must be deployed before it can be installed.

Run the following command from the project folder:
``` sh
ent prj install
```

If a project bundle has already been installed, use `--conflict-strategy` to adopt a strategy for existing components (CREATE, SKIP, OVERRIDE), e.g:
``` sh
ent prj install --conflict-strategy=OVERRIDE
```
#### Run a Project Locally
1. Initialize Keycloak, which leverages Docker Compose
``` sh
ent prj ext-keycloak start
```
2. Initialize backend microservices
``` sh
ent prj be-test-run
```
To fetch logs from bundle plugins, use the command
```
ent prj be-log
```
3. Initialize one or more frontend widgets, each from its own shell
``` sh
ent prj fe-test-run
```
Check out [Run Blueprint-generated Microservices and Micro Frontends in Dev Mode](../../tutorials/create/ms/run-local.md) for additional information.


#### Determine Project Identifiers
Entando uses a unique identifier for your project bundle as a way to provide additional security controls around bundle-specific resources. A unique identifier is also calculated for each microservice plugin in your project.

Determine the project bundle ID:
```sh
ent prj get-bundle-id --auto
```

Determine the plugin ID of each microservice in the project:
```sh
ent prj get-plugin-id --auto --repo=<BUNDLE-REPO-URL>
```

### Bundle Management
The sections below describe common bundle operations and provide the associated commands.
#### Prepare a Bundle for Publication

Use the `ent bundler` command to prepare a bundle for publication:

``` sh
  ent bundler from-git
```   

Alternatively, the project command `ent prj generate-cr` provides a wrapped version of `ent bundler` and prepares a bundle custom resource from a Git repository. The output of `ent prj generate-cr` is a YAML file which can be piped to `ent kubectl` for direct application to Kubernetes.

Consult the `ent prj generate-cr` help text for command options (e.g. bundle name, description, repository). For an example of how to use `ent prj generate-cr`, refer to the [Build and Publish a Simple Bundle tutorial](../../tutorials/create/pb/publish-simple-bundle.md).
#### Extract a Bundle from an Application

The bundler provides an interactive mode to identify the components to export from the application. Point the bundler to an existing Entando Application to extract its components (pages, content, etc.) and static assets into a custom bundle. This bundle can be used to migrate Entando components from one environment to another (e.g. Dev to QA), as a template for building a new Entando Application, or as the skeleton of an Entando solution. 

To generate the bundle folder structure for an Entando project, including a top-level descriptor file:
``` sh
  ent bundler from-env  
```

An `env.json` file to configure the application URLs and client credentials must live in the directory from which the bundler is run.

For example:
``` json
{
   "coreBaseApi": "http://YOUR-DOMAIN-OR-IP/entando-de-app",
   "componentManagerApi": "http://YOUR-DOMAIN-OR-IP/digital-exchange",
   "clientId": "YOUR-CLIENT-ID",
   "clientSecret": "YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET"
}
```

Instructions to export a bundle, including how to configure `env.json`, can be found in the [Export and Publish a Bundle tutorial](../../tutorials/create/pb/export-bundle-from-application.md).


#### Entando Component Repository Wrapper
Entando provides a series of `ent ecr` commands for interaction with [the Entando Component Repository](../../docs/compose/ecr-overview.md) (ECR). The following commands apply specifically and only to bundles.


Display the list of bundles associated with the current profile:
```
ent ecr list
```

Generate a bundle and deploy it to the current profile:
```
ent ecr deploy
``` 

The helpers `get-bundle-id` and `get-plugin-id` have been added to `ent ecr` to calculate and display unique custom resource identifiers. This provides additional security controls around bundle-specific and microservice plugin resources.

Determine the bundle ID:
```
ent ecr get-bundle-id YOUR-BUNDLE-REPOSITORY-URL
```

Determine the plugin ID:
```
ent ecr get-plugin-id --auto YOUR-BUNDLE-REPOSITORY-URL
```
### Profile Management
Manage and switch between different Entando configurations with `ent profile`, which uses Kubernetes contexts, kubeconfig files, and/or custom commands (refer to `ent profile first-use-readme`).

Cloud Kubernetes tools typically create a Kubernetes context which can be linked to an Entando profile. An overview of the current connection and profile information is provided via `ent status`.

The following commands perform common operations associated with profile management.

#### New Profile

Create and switch to a new profile:
```
ent pro new [profileName] [EntandoAppName] [namespace]
```
This sets the minimal profile data and explains next steps.

#### Link Profile

Link the current profile to a Kubernetes context (alias of `ent attach-kubectx`):
```
ent pro link [contextName]
```
This provides the instructions for ent to connect to the Kubernetes containing the Entando Application.

#### Global Profile

Activate the profile that ent should use across shells:
```
ent pro use [profileName]
```
This attempts to fully restore a profile type by considering the login and related Entando Applications.

#### Local Profile

Activate the profile that ent should use within the current shell:
```
source ent pro use [profileName]
```

This allows ent instances in different shells to simultaneously use different Kube contexts, kubeconfigs or custom commands. The quickstart script creates a profile named "qs--{vmname}" that is associated with the Entando Application it generates. 
#### Print

Print a list of the available profiles:
```
ent pro list
```

#### Delete

Delete a profile:
```
ent pro delete [profileName]
```

### Configuration Management
The output of `ent config` is a key-value archive of configurations related to the current profile.
It can serve several purposes, but a few "good to know" keys and commands are below.

#### Commands
Print the current config archive:
```
ent config --print
```
Interactively edit a config archive:
```
ent config --edit
```
Return the value of a config key:
```
ent config --get {key}
```
Set the value of a config key:
```
ent config --set {key} {value}
```
Delete a config key:
```
ent config --set {key}
```
#### Keys
| Key  | Definition  |
|---|---|
| ENTANDO_NAMESPACE  |  stores the fallback namespace used by explicit or implicit runs of `ent kubectl` |
|  ENTANDO_APPNAME | stores the Entando Application name related to the current profile |
|  DESIGNATED_JAVA_HOME | stores the path of the Java version used internally by ent |

## Diagnostics and Debug

### Diagnostic Commands

Diagnostic information can be highly useful when analyzing and troubleshooting behavior. The Getting Started guide includes steps to [automatically install](../../docs/getting-started/README.md#automatic-install) the CLI in a Multipass VM. The following commands can be run from this VM for insight into an Entando Application.

#### Basic Information

Display basic information about Kubernetes and Entando resources (e.g. namespace, pods, ingresses):
``` sh
ent app-info
```

#### Pod Logs

Display `kubectl describe` and `kubectl logs` for each of the major Entando pods in a namespace:
``` sh
ent pod-info
```

#### Diagnostic Files

List the current pods in an Entando namespace and prepare a diagnostic tar.gz:
``` sh
ent diag
```
This outputs `kubectl describe` and `kubectl logs` for each of the fundamental Entando pods. It also exports custom resources, ingresses, deployments, "previous" pod logs, namespace events, etc.  

The directory paths of the diagnostic logs are listed, similar to the following:

```
> Collected diagdata available under "~/.entando/reports/entando-diagdata-2020-11-19T02:58:47+0000" for consultation
> Collected diagdata available in archive "~/.entando/reports/entando-diagdata-2020-11-19T02:58:47+0000.tgz"
```
### Troubleshooting
The CLI is a useful tool for debugging issues with an Entando instance. 
#### Error Location
Locate error messages in the EntandoApp pods:
``` bash
ent pod grep --all "error|fail"
```
or
``` bash
ent pod grep ".*" "error|fail"
```
#### Extraction Error
To resolve the error "Unable to extract the application client secret":

1. Verify that the current profile namespace and application name are correct and match the output of the following command
``` sh
ent status
```
2. Assign the appropriate namespace and application name
``` sh
ent appname YOUR-APPNAME
ent namespace YOUR-NAMESPACE
```
